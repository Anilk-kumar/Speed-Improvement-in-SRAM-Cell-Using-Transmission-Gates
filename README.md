# Speed-Improvement-in-SRAM-Cell-Using-Transmission-Gates
In the proposed TGD8T SRAM Cell, transmission gates are used in the feedback path instead of Pass Transistors. 
These transmission gates are modelled in two cases. 
The first case uses LVT (low threshold voltage) type and the second case uses HVT type of P-MOSFET and NMOSFET.
